I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Management Science at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research lies at the intersection of operations management, data-driven decision-making, and sustainable supply chains. I develop optimization and learning methods for operational problems under uncertainty—especially in settings with limited data and complex strategic interactions—and validate the insights using real-world applications.

**Research interests**
- Data-driven optimization and learning under limited data
- Supply chain coordination and contract design
- Sustainable operations and circular economy (e.g., EPR, recycling systems)
